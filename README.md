## MetroManifesto

Welcome to Berlin, the city of the greatest Untergrundbahn the world has ever seen!

We are in great need of young conductors for our trains, ones that will keep their passengers in line and their trains on time!
Drive your train through each of the Ubahn routes in Berlin - Deutsche punktlichkeit is important for our image as a superior nation.
Every person on the train *must* pay the fare for riding on the Ubahn. If you do not catch these people, you will be aiding to the bankruptcy of our city.
Babies, buskers, and drunks must be kept quiet and in order. In fact, anybody with food or drink must be reprimanded, or else our trains will be filled with
litter!

You will be rewarded handsomely if you perform well. If you help benefit our city, you may have some say in upgrading our infrastructure.
Modifications to make trains quieter, faster, or easier to clean will help please more passengers, thus making our transport system more profitable.
